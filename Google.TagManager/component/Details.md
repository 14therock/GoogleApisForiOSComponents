Google Tag Manager enables developers to change configuration values in their mobile applications using the Google Tag Manager interface without having to rebuild and resubmit application binaries to app marketplaces.

This is useful for managing any configuration values or flags in your application that you may need to change in the future, including:

- Various UI settings and display strings
- Sizes, locations, or types of ads served in your application
- Game settings

Configuration values may also be evaluated at runtime using rules, enabling dynamic configurations such as:

- Using screen size to determine ad banner size
- Using language and location to configure UI elements

Google TagManager also enables the dynamic implementation of tracking tags and pixels in applications. Developers can push important events into a data layer and decide later which tracking tags or pixels should be fired. TagManager currently supports the following tags:

- Google Mobile App Analytics
- Custom Function Call tag
