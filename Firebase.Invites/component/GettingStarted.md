# Send and Receive Firebase Invites from Your iOS App

## Prerequisites

Firebase Invites requires iOS 8 or newer. You can target iOS 7 in your app, but all Firebase Invites SDK calls will be no-ops if the app isn't running on iOS 8 or newer.

## Add Firebase to your app

1. Create a Firebase project in the [Firebase console][1], if you don't already have one. If you already have an existing Google project associated with your mobile app, click **Import Google Project**. Otherwise, click **Create New Project**.
2. Click **Add Firebase to your iOS app** and follow the setup steps. If you're importing an existing Google project, this may happen automatically and you can just [download the config file][2].
3. When prompted, enter your app's bundle ID. It's important to enter the bundle ID your app is using; this can only be set when you add an app to your Firebase project.
4. At the end, you'll download a `GoogleService-Info.plist` file. You can [download this file][2] again at any time.
5. Go to **Project settings**, in **General** tab select your recently created iOS bundle ID.
6. Set your App Store ID, you can find your App Store ID in your appâ€™s URL. (e.g. https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/yourapp/id123456789, **123456789** is your App Store ID).
7. Set your Team ID, you can find your Team ID in the Apple Member Center under the [membership tab][3].
8. You must enable Firebase Dynamic Links to use Firebase Invites. In [Firebase console][1], in your project menu go to Dynamic Links tab, accept the terms of service if you are prompted to do so, copy Url link, paste it into your Navigation bar and add **/apple-app-site-association** (e.g https://app_code.app.goo.gl//apple-app-site-association)
9. Your app is connected if the apple-app-site-association file contains a reference to your app's App Store ID and bundle ID, for example:

```
{"applinks":{"apps":[],"details":[{"appID":"1234567890.com.example.ios","paths":["/*"]}]}}
```

If the details field is empty, double-check that you specified your Team ID.

If you haven't created a Dynamic Link follow this [documentation][3].

## Configure Invites in your app

Once you have your `GoogleService-Info.plist` file downloaded in your computer, do the following steps in Xamarin Studio:

1. Add `GoogleService-Info.plist` file to your app project.
2. Set `GoogleService-Info.plist` **build action** behaviour to `Bundle Resource` by Right clicking/Build Action.
3. Open `GoogleService-Info.plist` file and change `IS_SIGNIN_ENABLED` and `IS_APPINVITE_ENABLED` values to `Yes`.
4. Add the following line of code somewhere in your app, typically in your AppDelegate's `FinishedLaunching` method (don't forget to import `Firebase.Analytics` namespace):

```csharp
App.Configure ();
```

## Google Sign-In

Users must be signed in with their Google Accounts to send invitations. Follow [Google Sign-In getting started][4] to integrate Sign-In into your app.

## Handle incoming app invites

After you have configured your app, you must next enable your app to handle incoming app invites.

When a user selects an incoming app invite on their iOS device, if the user has not yet installed your app, they can choose to install your app from its iTunes App Store page. When the user opens your app for the first time, it's important for your app to provide a personalized onboarding experience to increase the likelihood they will become an engaged, long-term user of your app. To help you do this, the Invites SDK provides the deeplink and invitation ID associated with the app invite received by the user.

**_Note: If the Invites SDK indicates a weak match for a deeplink, it means that the match between the deeplink and the receiving device may not be perfect. In this case your app should reveal no personal information from the deeplink._**

```csharp
// Support for iOS 9 or later
public override bool OpenUrl (UIApplication app, NSUrl url, NSDictionary options)
{
	var openUrlOptions = new UIApplicationOpenUrlOptions (options);
	return OpenUrl (app, url, openUrlOptions.SourceApplication, openUrlOptions.Annotation);
}

// Support for iOS 8 or before
public override bool OpenUrl (UIApplication application, NSUrl url, string sourceApplication, NSObject annotation)
{
	// Handle App Invite requests
	var invite = Invites.HandleUrl (url, sourceApplication, annotation);

	if (invite != null) {
		var matchType = invite.MatchType == ReceivedInviteMatchType.Weak ? "Weak" : "Strong";
		var message = $"Deep link from {sourceApplication}\nInvite ID: {invite.InviteId}\nApp Url: {invite.DeepLink}\nMatch Type: {matchType}";
		System.Console.WriteLine ($"Depp-Link Data: {message}");

		return true;
	}

	// Handle Sign In
	return SignIn.SharedInstance.HandleUrl (url, sourceApplication, annotation);
}
```

## Enable your users to send app invites

Before a user can send Invites, the user must be signed in with their Google Account.

To send invitations, first declare a class that implements the IInviteDelegate interface:

```csharp
public class InviteViewController : DialogViewController, IInviteDelegate
```

Then, add a **Send Invitation** button to your app. You can add this button as an option in your main menu, or add this button alongside your deep-linkable content, so that users can send specific content along with the invitation. See the [Firebase Invites best practices][5].

When users tap your **Send Invitation** button, open the invitation dialog:

```csharp
// NOTE: You must have the App Store ID set in your developer console project
// in order for invitations to successfully be sent.
public void SendInvite ()
{
	// When you create the invitation dialog, you must specify the title
	// of the invitation dialog and the invitation message to send. 
	// You can also customize the image and deep link URL that 
	// get sent in the invitation
	var inviteDialog = Invites.GetInviteDialog ();
	inviteDialog.SetInviteDelegate (this);
	inviteDialog.SetTitle ("Invites Sample");
	
	// A message hint for the dialog. Note this manifests differently depending on the
    // received invitation type. For example, in an email invite this appears as the subject.
	inviteDialog.SetMessage ($"Try this out! {anUrl}");
	
	// These following values are optionals and are only sent via email
	inviteDialog.SetDeepLink ("app_url");
	inviteDialog.SetDescription ("A description of the app");
	inviteDialog.SetCustomImage ("The url of the image");
	inviteDialog.SetCallToActionText ("Button title of the invitations");
	
	// If you have an Android version of your app and you want to send
	// an invitation that can be opened on Android in addition to iOS
	var targetApp = new InvitesTargetApplication {
			AndroidClientId = "Android ID"
	};
	inviteDialog.SetOtherPlatformsTargetApplication (targetApp);

	inviteDialog.Open ();
}
```

If you want to learn more about Invitation parts, see the following [documentation][6].

After the user sends the invitation, your app calls `InviteFinished` method of `IInviteDelegate` interface:

```csharp
[Export ("inviteFinishedWithInvitations:error:")]
public void InviteFinished (string [] invitationIds, NSError error)
{
	if (error == null) {
		foreach (var id in invitationIds)
			System.Console.WriteLine (id);
	} else {
		System.Console.WriteLine (error.LocalizedDescription);
	}

}
```

Configuring your App
--------------------

Google provides an easy to use configuration web tool to generate a config file for your app:  

1. Open [Google's configuration tool][1] to create a config file for your app.
2. Enter your app's name and iOS Bundle ID and click continue
3. Enter your App Store ID and click *Enable App Invites*
   (If you don't have an App Store ID you can use one of our favorites - 1000846120 or 783488172)
4. Click *continue* to generate the configuration files
5. Click *Download Google-Service-Info.plist*
6. Add `GoogleService-Info.plist` to your Xamarin.iOS app project and set the *Build Action* to `BundleResource`
7. In your Xamarin.iOS app project's `Info.plist` file, add the following URL Types:
  - Identifier: `google` Role: `Editor` URL Schemes: `your.app.bundle.id` 
  - Identifier: `google` Role: `Editor` URL Schemes: `value of REVERSED_CLIENT_ID from GoogleService-Info.plist`
  

Setup your AppDelegate
----------------------

In order for App Invites to work properly, you must tell the SDK about some of your application lifecycle events.

In your `AppDelegate.cs`, in the `FinishedLaunching (..)` override, you should add the following code to the start of the method:

```csharp
NSError configureError;
Context.SharedInstance.Configure (out configureError);
if (configureError != null)
	Console.WriteLine ("Error configuring the Google context: {0}", configureError);
 
Invite.ApplicationDidFinishLaunching ();
```

Next, add the following override to your AppDelegate class (or if it already exists, add the code inside the method to the existing implementation:

```csharp
public override bool OpenUrl (UIApplication application, NSUrl url, string sourceApplication, NSObject annotation)
{
	// Handle App Invite requests
	var invite = Invite.HandleUrl (url, sourceApplication, annotation);
	if (invite != null) {
		var message =string.Format ("Deep link from {0} \nInvite ID: {1}\nApp URL: {2}",
			sourceApplication, invite.InviteId, invite.DeepLink);
		new UIAlertView (@"Deep-link Data", message, null, "OK").Show ();
		return true;
	}
 
	return SignIn.SharedInstance.HandleUrl (url, sourceApplication, annotation);
}
```


Signing In
----------

In order for app invites to work, your app's user must sign in to their Google account.  To do this, you should request a login in your View Controller.  This can be done in the `ViewDidLoad` override:

```csharp
// Sign the user in automatically
SignIn.SharedInstance.UIDelegate = this;
SignIn.SharedInstance.Delegate = this;
SignIn.SharedInstance.SignInUser ();
```
You also must implement `ISignInDelegate` as well as `ISignInUIDelegate` and provide a `DidSignIn` method to know when the sign-in completed and if it was successful:

```csharp
public void DidSignIn (SignIn signIn, GoogleUser user, NSError error)
{
	if (user != null && error == null)
		// Enable App Invite button
}
```
For more information on Google Sign-In please refer to the [Getting Started Guide][2]

Displaying the AppInvite UI
---------------------------

Once your user is signed in, you can display the AppInvite UI with the following code:

```csharp
var inviteDialog = Invite.InviteDialog;
inviteDialog.SetInviteDelegate (this);
 
// NOTE: You must have the App Store ID set in your developer console project
// in order for invitations to successfully be sent.
var message = string.Format ("Try this out!\n -{0}",
	SignIn.SharedInstance.CurrentUser.Profile.Name);
 
// A message hint for the dialog. Note this manifests differently depending on the
// received invation type. For example, in an email invite this appears as the subject.
inviteDialog.SetMessage (message);
 
// Title for the dialog, this is what the user sees before sending the invites.
inviteDialog.SetTitle ("App Invites Example");
inviteDialog.SetDeepLink ("app_url");
inviteDialog.Open ();
```

You can should also implement `IInviteDelegate` and optionally the `InviteFinished` method to be notified when the user has completed the AppInvite dialog:

```csharp
[Export ("inviteFinishedWithInvitations:error:")]
public virtual void InviteFinished (string[] invitationIds, NSError error)
{
	var message = error != null ? error.LocalizedDescription :
		string.Format ("{0} invites sent", invitationIds.Length);
 
	new UIAlertView ("Done", message, null, "OK").Show ();
}
```
